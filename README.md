As we see currently there are lots of applications of face detection, like some of the examples where face detection is used is in smartphone face detection is used to authenticate the identity of the user, face detection is used in home security cameras and so on.  So, in my project I have implemented a program which takes an input image and detects the faces in that image and outputs the count of the number of faces found in that image and a rectangle around the faces in that image.
